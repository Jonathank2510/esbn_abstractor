# Data Efficient Language Modeling using Emergent Symbol Binding

In this project, we are trying to implement a data efficient language model using the ESBN architecture. First, we reimplement the original model from the paper in tensorflow and then we 
adapt the model to work with text data and perform next word prediction.
